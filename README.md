# flutter_weather_app_mvvm

A weather flutter app following MVVM architecture. This is a small Flutter project to begin with.

- [For statemanagement I have used StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
- [For network calls I used the popular Flutter package Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
- [For weather forecast App using Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
